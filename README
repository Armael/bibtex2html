BibTeX2HTML is a collection of tools for producing automatically HTML
documents from bibliographies written in the BibTeX format. It
consists in two command line tools:

  - bib2bib is a filter tool that reads one or several bibliography
    files, filters the entries with respect to a given criterion, and
    outputs the list of selected keys together with a new bibliography
    file containing only the selected entries; 

  - bibtex2html is a translator that reads a bibliography file and
    outputs two HTML documents that respectively the cited
    bibliography in a nice presentation, and the original BibTeX file
    augmented with several transparent HTML links to allow easy 
    navigation.

INSTALLATION
============

  You need Objective Caml to compile the sources.
 
  1. Configure with "./configure" then compile with "make all".  It
     creates two binary files, "bibtex2html" and "bib2bib" .

     If you want  to build the documentation, do  "make doc" (You need
     both LaTeX and Hevea).

  2. Edit the Makefile to set  the variables BINDIR, MANDIR and DOCDIR
     (at  the very  beginning) and  do  "make install".  You may  need
     superuser permissions.

     (Note:  you  can  also  just  copy the  two  executables  in  any
     directory of your choice)

     To install the doc, do "make install-doc".
