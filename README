BibTeX2HTML is a collection of tools for producing automatically HTML
documents from bibliographies written in the BibTeX format. It
consists in two command line tools:

  - bib2bib is a filter tool that reads one or several bibliography
    files, filters the entries with respect to a given criterion, and
    outputs the list of selected keys together with a new bibliography
    file containing only the selected entries; 

  - bibtex2html is a translator that reads a bibliography file and
    outputs two HTML documents that respectively the cited
    bibliography in a nice presentation, and the original BibTeX file
    augmented with several transparent HTML links to allow easy 
    navigation.

     or by copying the files "by hand".
