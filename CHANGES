   . if no -oc option, no citation file created at all 
 o bib2bib now supports options --version and --warranty

 o bib2bib is able to parse conditions of the form field:regexp (but
   only one condition at a time)

    . option -noexpand produces an bib output still containing @STRINGs 
      (but notice that crossrefs are never expanded)
 o the default bibtex command is "bibtex -min-crossrefs=1000" in order
    to avoid citation to the crossrefs. (This behaviour is obtained
    only when using a -citefile where the crossrefs are not included.)
 o macros with nested braces now recognized correctly 
 o macros \textrm and \textsl
 o option -citefile to read keys to cite from a file
 o macros \sim, \symbol; macros for accents without argument (\~{}, \'{}, etc.)
