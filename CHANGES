 o added options -fsuffix / -lsuffix to specify different suffixes for
   HTML files and links (-suffix s is equivalent to -fsuffix s -lsuffix s)
 o fixed bug: entries were sorted in reverse order when no order specified
 o remove nested tags <a> (incorrect HTML)
 o closed tags <td> with </td>
 o added macro \html (raw HTML)
 o fixed bug with both -nodoc and -multiple

Version 1.3, 2/6/2000
=====================
 o sorting according to dates: bibtex2html no more fails on incorrect
   dates but issues a warning; if no date is present, the date of the
   crossref is used, if any.
 o macros: \LaTeX, \v, \tm, \sl
 o character / in keys
 o option --hevea-url to translate macro \url as HeVeA's instead of LaTeX's
 o bib2bib now takes care of repeated entries (See the manual)
 o \textsf now translated as \textbf (i.e. to bold face)
 o production of valid HTML (Thanks to John Kewley)

Version 1.2, 1999/02/10
=======================
 o manual.tex does not require hevea.sty anymore
 o fixed wrong link to bibtex entries in the page with abstracts
 o implementation: use of the ocaml module Buffer
 o fixed bug: authorize & in keys
 o bib2bib conditions now take LaTeX accents into account. For example
   \'e, \'{e} and é are all considered identical. Some accents still
   have to be considered. A new module Latex_accents has been added
   for that purpose.
 o much more LaTeX macros translated
 o macro \u (a romanian accent) recognized (but \u{s} simply outputs s) 
 o option --raw-url to print URL instead of files's types.
 
Version 1.1, 1999/11/05
=======================
 o bibtex2html version is written at the end of the document and inside the
   HTML source
 o options --output and --nobibsource for bibtex2html
 o bibtex2html now reads on standard input if no input file is given, 
   and writes on standard output (if no output file is specified).
 o new option of bib2bib: --expand expands the abbreviations
 o macro \neq -> <>
 o Readbib now outputs messages on standard error, not standard output
 o in bib2bib conditions, $ means the key of an entry
 o changed behaviour of bib2bib, in order to be used as a filter :
   . if no input files, input is taken from standard input
   . if no -ob option, output is done on standard output
   . if no -oc option, no citation file created at all 
 o bib2bib now supports options --version and --warranty
 o macro \% -> %
 o macro \ss -> &szlig;
 o authorize + in keys

Version 1.0, 1999/07/15
=======================
 o option --footer
 o condition are now arbitrary boolean expressions over comparaisons
   and matchings
 o macro \mathcal 
 o bib2bib is able to parse conditions of the form field:regexp (but
   only one condition at a time)
 o the bib output :
    . is in the same order as the original one
    . option -noexpand produces an bib output still containing @STRINGs 
      (but notice that crossrefs are never expanded)
 o the default bibtex command is "bibtex -min-crossrefs=1000" in order
    to avoid citation to the crossrefs. (This behaviour is obtained
    only when using a -citefile where the crossrefs are not included.)
 o macros with nested braces now recognized correctly 
 o macros \textrm and \textsl
 o option -citefile to read keys to cite from a file
 o macros \sim, \symbol; macros for accents without argument (\~{}, \'{}, etc.)
